## Reverse Engineering
### Challenge 1: keygenme-py
### Point Value: 30 Points
### Description: Using the given program, find the code by figuring out how the program works and how to get the flag from it.
#### Steps Taken:
- Downloaded the given .py file into the shell
- Used the python command on the file to run it
- Tried the different menus the program prompts you to, couldn't find anything
- Exited the program and used cat on it to view the code
- Found part of the flag
- Found part of a password needed to be used in the program to unlock the 'full version'
- Found that the password has a part that is dynamically generated in the program
- Tried moving lines of code around and removing code but nothing worked

## Forensics
### Challenge 1: information
### Point Value: 10 Points
### Description: Find the flag in the data of the given .jpg file
#### Steps Taken:
- Downloaded the file to the shell
- Used the cat command on the file but found nothing useful
- Used the nano command on the file and found some more information about the file
- I saw 'picoCTF' mentioned and clicked on the links that were displayed
- The one link was about metadata, so I'm assuming the metadata is important to this challenge
- I wasn't sure what to do next or had ideas on what else I could do, so I googled the challenge
- I found the solution here (Website: https://github.com/vivian-dai/PicoCTF2021-Writeup/blob/main/Forensics/information/information.md)
- They noticed this string of text 'cGljb0NURnt0aGVfbTN0YWRhdGFfMXNfbW9kaWZpZWR9', which I also saw when I used nano
- They put it through a base64 decrypter to find the flag, and I did the same

## Binary Exploitation
### Challenge 1: Cache Me Outside
### Point Value: 70 Points
### Description: Find the flag using heap allocations
#### Steps Taken:
- As the hint suggested, I looked up GLIBC's tcache to learn more about it (Website: https://azeria-labs.com/heap-exploitation-part-2-glibc-heap-free-bins/)
- It seems that the tcache used seems to speed up requests to a server, but causes the server to be more vulnerable to attacks
- Downloaded the given files with wget
- Tried connecting to the given server to see what is happening
- Server prompted to change a byte in the program and is asking for an Address
- Unsure of what to do, I used cat on each of the downloaded files, still wasn't sure what else I could do
- Tried using the strings command on each of the files but didn't find the flag
- Tried using the grep command but didn't find the flag
- I ended up searching online for a solution (Website: https://github.com/Dvd848/CTFs/blob/master/2021_picoCTF/Cache_Me_Outside.md)
- I still have a hard time understanding what is going on, but I think the program wants you to call a heap and have it point to another one to get the flag

### Challenge 2: Unsubscriptions Are Free
### Point Value: 100 Points
### Description: 
#### Steps Taken:
- Downloaded the given files onto the shell using wget
- Looked at the hint which led me to a pdf explaining heap overflow and double-free attacks
- After reading the pdf, went to the shell and connected to the provided server
- Saw the menu options and went through each of them
- While going through the menu options, I got a timeout
- I used cat, nano, and less on the downloaded files
- in the vuln.c file, I found a 'flag.txt' mentioned in a function, leading me to try and find a way to get to call that function.
- I went back to the server and connected, and noticed a 'memory leak' with a value in
- Tried to find a way to change the 'memory leak' into text but couldn't find anything
- Tried modifying the code of the program and compiling it with the 'gcc' command
- Ran the file but still didn't get the flag
- Wasn't sure what else to try, so looked up a solution (Website: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffJRcNEyApI)
- He explains in the video that memory needs to be freed than reallocated so that it can be accessed

## Highest Difficulty
### Challenge Name: Java Script Kiddie 2
### Point Value: 500 Points
### Description: Fix the given link using Java Script and find the flag
#### Steps Taken:
- Went into the shell and tried to connect in the shell using the nc command, but was told I was missing the port number
- Copy and pasted the link into Google and was brought to a website prompting me to enter something into a search box
- Looked at the page source, found nothing useful
- Used the inspect tool
- Found a variable called 'key', tried to copy and paste it into the search box, it didn't work
- Continued looking around with the inspect tool, but couldn't find anything
- Wasn't sure what else to do, looked for a solution online (Website: https://blog.srikavin.me/posts/picoctf-2019-java-script-kiddie-2/)
- The challenge is similar to a previous one, which I didn't do, so it was hard for me to understand it all
- From what I gathered, it seems that a script was created from the last challenged and slightly modified to get a code
- This code then had to be converted from base64 and inserted into the given website's search bar, revealing a QR code that contains the flag
